## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I earned my Ph.D. in 2023 from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), with a significant portion of my research conducted at Purdue University as a visiting student. I have worked on hybrid models for inverse problems as a part of my PhD thesis under the guidance of Prof. S. Gopalakrishan and Prof. S. Dyke. Prior to my doctoral studies, I served as a Research Fellow at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, and completed my Masterâ€™s in 2018 at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST). More about bio/cv.

My primary research interests incline towards generative models, uncertainty quantification and interpretibility. My research focuses on the application of novel scientific ML methods for solving general PDEs, structural health monitoring, wave propagation analysis, material property estimation, discovery and design, particle accelerators, safety, resilience, and cyber-physical testing of smart habitats, robotics for inspection. 

Beyond research, I enjoy staying active through football, cricket, strength training, and running. These activities help me maintain physical fitness and mental clarity, balancing the demands of my academic work. I like spending time with colleagues outside of work.
