## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory. In 2023, I earned my Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), with a significant portion of my research conducted at Purdue University as a visiting student. My Ph.D. thesis focused on hybrid models for inverse problems, under the guidance of Prof. S. Gopalakrishan and Prof. S. Dyke. Prior to my doctoral studies, I was a Research Fellow at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur and completed my Masterâ€™s in 2018 at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST).

My primary research interests lie in generative models, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability. I apply novel scientific machine learning methods to solve problems in/related to (a) general partial differential equations (PDEs), (b) structural health monitoring, (c) material properties estimation, (d) beam dynamics in particle accelerators, (e) plasma physics, (f) safety and resilience, cyber-physical testing of smart habitats, and (g) robotics for inspection.

Outside of research, I maintain an active lifestyle through football, cricket, strength training, and running. These activities help me stay physically fit and mentally focused, providing a healthy balance to the demands of my academic work. I also enjoy spending time with colleagues beyond work.
